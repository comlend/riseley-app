    for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and freedom from computer virus or other harmful code. We do not warrant
    that any information provided by us is accurate, complete, or useful, that our services will be operational, error free,
    secure, or safe, or that our services will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. We do not control,
    and are not responsible for, controlling how or when our users use our services or the features, services, and interfaces

    connected with any such claim you have against any third parties. You waive any rights you may have under California
    civil code &sect;1542, or any other similar applicable statute or law of any other jurisdiction, which says that: a general
